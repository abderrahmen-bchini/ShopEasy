# ⭐ Anna Beauty – Mobile Application

A modern mobile application designed for beauty salons, inspired by a real request from the owner of *Anna Beauty Salon*. The app solves common salon-management problems by offering online booking, digital catalogs, loyalty rewards, and client history — all in one place.

## 📌 1. Problem Definition

Many beauty salons still rely on manual appointment management (calls, messages, paper agendas), leading to:

* Double-booking and scheduling errors
* Time wasted on back-and-forth messaging
* No organized client history or loyalty tracking
* Limited visibility of services and pricing
* No central catalog for beauty accessories or products

As the business grows, these issues scale and reduce efficiency.

## 🎯 2. Target Users

### **Primary Users**

* **Salon Clients**
  Want quick booking, real-time availability, service browsing, and access to appointment history.

### **Secondary Users**

* **Salon Owner (Anna)**
  Needs an automated system to manage bookings and showcase services/products easily.
* **Salon Employees**
  Benefit from organized schedules and real-time appointment updates.

---

## 💡 3. Inspiration & Motivation

This project started from a simple request:
The salon owner wanted a small website to showcase accessories she sells.

This sparked the idea:

> **Why not build a full mobile application that benefits both the salon and its clients?**

Instead of a simple catalog, the app expands into:

* Automated appointment scheduling
* Service and set galleries
* Client loyalty system
* Centralized product catalog

The result is a modern, user-friendly, and competitive digital solution.
